🎉 AUTO-RESPOND ISSUE FIXED - SYSTEM READY!
=====================================================

✅ PROBLEM RESOLVED:
The "Failed to respond to 16 emails" error has been fixed!

🔧 WHAT WAS THE ISSUE:
- The sentiment analysis data was stored as a string, but the AI service expected a dictionary
- This caused "'str' object has no attribute 'get'" errors

🛠️ HOW IT WAS FIXED:
- Updated the generate_response method to handle both string and dictionary formats
- Added JSON parsing for string sentiment data
- Created fallback sentiment data structure
- Added better error handling and logging

✅ CURRENT STATUS:
- ✅ Auto-respond API working (Status: 200)
