# üöÄ Complete GitHub Upload Instructions

## Step 1: Set Up Git Configuration (First Time Only)

Before you can commit to Git, you need to configure your identity. Run these commands in PowerShell:

```bash
# Replace with your actual name and email
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"

# Alternative: Set only for this project (without --global)
cd "d:\unstop project\p5\final app 1"
git config user.name "Your Name"
git config user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

## Step 2: Complete the Git Setup

After setting your name and email, continue with:

```bash
cd "d:\unstop project\p5\final app 1"

# Create the initial commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: AI-Powered Email Analysis Bot with Django and Perplexity AI"

# Create main branch
git branch -M main
```
